    <p>Double cleansing involves using two different types of cleansers to thoroughly clean your skin. Here's how to do it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup and sunscreen.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Follow up with a water-based cleanser to remove any remaining impurities and cleanse the skin deeply.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using both types of cleansers, you ensure your skin is thoroughly cleaned without being stripped of moisture!</p>

    <p>Vitamin C is known for its brightening properties and its ability to fight free radicals, which cause premature aging. Here's why you should include it in your routine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brightening:</strong> Vitamin C helps even out your skin tone and reduce dark spots.</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-aging:</strong> It helps boost collagen production, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Vitamin C protects your skin from environmental stressors like pollution and UV damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure to apply Vitamin C serum in the morning and follow up with sunscreen for maximum protection!</p>
